# Minimal React Setup

While it is useful for using Create-React-App to get started in your project, I often find that whatever is inside is too bloated. Moreover, as a professional developer, we should all learn how to set up our project.

So this is an example of what I think is the minimal react app setup. In the master branch, you will find only the following setup:
1. React 16.5
2. Babel 7
3. Webpack 4
4. ESLint
5. Prettier
6. Jest
7. Enzyme

I will create another branch to set up GraphQL using the Apollo Library.
